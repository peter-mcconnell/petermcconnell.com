I'm a solid debugger, reasonable systems designer, ok coder & natural leader
who leans heavy into automation / giving people the power to do their jobs.
I've worked with enough talent to know I'm nothing special; but I have a great
track record for being easy to work with and getting shit done be it as an IC,
a manager, or a group lead.

Usually never far from:

- Linux
- Python
- Golang
- Bash
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- AWS

Over 20 years I've touched a lot of different tech and generally speaking can
shake the rust off or learn something new in a week or two.

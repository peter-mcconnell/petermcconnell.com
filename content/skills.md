I'm a solid debugger, reasonable systems designer & natural leader. I've worked
with enough talent to know I'm nothing special; but I have a great track record
for being good to work with and getting shit done be it as an IC, a manager,
or a group lead.

Usually never far from:

- Python
- Golang
- Bash
- Linux
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- AWS

Over 20 years I've touched a lot of different tech and generally speaking can
shake the rust off or learn something new in a week or two.

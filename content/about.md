When I was around 9 through some miracle mum brought home a Commodore Amiga.
My family never had much growing up but somehow we still got a computer. Little
did she know at the time just how big an impact that would have on my life -
thanks Mum. I gorged on all the Warez I could get my hands slowly increasing
my exposure to programming and hacking. The culture has always felt like home.

Eventually I had to earn money and knew working with computers was something I
had to do - any other job would feel like work and I didn't much like work. So
with some luck and a sprinkle of white-lies I landed my first web developer
role around 2004 and was hooked.

Fast forward some years, I'm currently posted at firebolt.io where I help
several teams who are focused around automation and running infrastructure. We
have many complex problems to solve but the progress we're making is truly
amazing. Oblig. "My views are my own / not representative of my employer"

Outside of work I try to contribute to the community when I can, though spare
time is expensive when you have kids to spend it on. I recently got to speak at
NIDC though which was nice - you can catch it here:

Final Fantasy VII t-shirt.

Personal focus has shifted towards performance and systems engineering lately.
In particular, pulling more information out of the kernel to help developers
debug interesting issues is a fascinating topic I'm spending more time on. The
problem is, with such tools to hand life seemingly becomes an endless longing
for a process to spin out of control with not a reasonable error in sight.

I'm a simple high-school drop-out that has been in love with computers since
landing my very own Commodore Amiga. My family never had much growing up, but
somehow I still got a computer. Little did my mum know at the time just how big
an impact that would have on my life. Thanks mum.

Currently posted at firebolt.io where I help several teams who are focused
around automation and running infrastructure. We have many complex problems to
solve but the progress we're making is truly amazing. Oblig. "My views are my
own / not representative of my employer"

Outside of work I try to contribute to the community when I can, though spare
time is expensive when you have kids to spend it on. I recently got to speak at
NIDC though which was nice - you can catch it here:

Final Fantasy VII t-shirt.

Personal focus has shifted towards performance and systems engineering lately.
In particular, pulling more information out of the kernel to help developers
debug interesting issues is a fascinating topic I'm spending more time on. The
problem is, with such tools to hand life seemingly becomes an endless longing
for a process to spin out of control with not a reasonable error in sight.

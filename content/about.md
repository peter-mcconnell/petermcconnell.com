$PATH
-----

When I was around 9 through some miracle mum brought home a Commodore Amiga.
My family never had much growing up but somehow we still got a computer. Little
did she know at the time just how big an impact that would have on my life -
thanks Mum. I gorged on all the Warez I could get my hands slowly increasing
my exposure to programming and hacking. The culture has always felt like home.

Eventually I had to earn money and knew working with computers was something I
had to do - any other job would feel like work and I didn't much like work. So
with some luck and a sprinkle of white-lies I landed my first web developer
role around 2004 and was hooked.

Fast forward some years, I'm currently posted at a stealth mode startup where I
work on eBPF with C and Golang to build security and observability tools.

Outside of work I try to contribute to the community when I can, though spare
time is expensive when you have kids to spend it on. I recently got to speak at
NIDC though which was nice - you can catch it here:

Final Fantasy VII t-shirt.

Personal focus has shifted towards performance and systems engineering lately.
In particular, pulling more information out of the kernel to help developers
debug interesting issues is a fascinating topic I'm spending more time on. The
problem is, with such tools to hand life seemingly becomes an endless longing
for a process to spin out of control with not a reasonable error in sight.

The Linux Programming Interface
-------------------------------

I should have read this years ago. It's a big boi, but if you work around linux
or are interested in it - this book is a critical primer on many of the core
topics you'll need to really understand what's going on. I binged this book on
the first pass over multiple weeks - deliberately skipping implementing the
code examples, opting to just read them / ensure I understood them. I choose to
do this so that I could get over as much content as possible, with the view of
circling back over the examples once I'm finished The C Programming Language
book so that I can make better decisions about the code I'm writing.

The C Programming Language
--------------------------

I generally try to avoid taking on multiple books but I figured as the above is
so large and much of the books example code is given in C, then this book which
I'm long overdue on would be a nice complement.

It's fine. Concise and clear wording. Unlike the print quality, unfortunately.
This book looks like it was hand-painted by a very nervous individual trying
to hit a deadline, in the dark. I'd say this is an important book, but not much
of a page-turned.

I have two "crackers" on my desk. Really looking forward to these:

- Linux Kernel Development (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Linux-Kernel-Development-Developers-Library/dp/0672329468)
- Systems Performance (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Systems-Performance-Brendan-Gregg/dp/0136820158)

        <p>I&rsquo;m a simple high-school drop-out that has been in love with computers since
landing my very own Commodore Amiga. My family never had much growing up, but
somehow I still got a computer. Little did my mum know at the time just how big
an impact that would have on my life. Thanks mum.</p>
<p>Currently posted at firebolt.io where I help several teams who are focused
around automation and running infrastructure. We have many complex problems to
solve but the progress we&rsquo;re making is truly amazing. Oblig. &ldquo;My views are my
own / not representative of my employer&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside of work I try to contribute to the community when I can, though spare
time is expensive when you have kids to spend it on. I recently got to speak at
NIDC though which was nice - you can catch it here:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvtZnbDXpzM&amp;t=20063s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvtZnbDXpzM&amp;t=20063s</a>. And indeed, that is a
Final Fantasy VII t-shirt.</p>
<p>Personal focus has shifted towards performance and systems engineering lately.
In particular, pulling more information out of the kernel to help developers
debug interesting issues is a fascinating topic I&rsquo;m spending more time on. The
problem is, with such tools to hand life seemingly becomes an endless longing
for a process to spin out of control with not a reasonable error in sight.</p>

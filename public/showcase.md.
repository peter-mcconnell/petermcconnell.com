I've been around the tech scene for two decades and in that time have
delivered much that I'm proud of. The following lists a few key highlights:

 - have worked on web products for Google, Virgin, Red Bull, Disney & YouTube `[ Python. PHP. During my time as a lead at https://www.rehabagency.ai/work ]` shipping apps that seen millions of users in their first week of deployment, featuring on the google.com homepage (under the search bar)
 - developed a custom query language, TQL (an OpenCypher variant), and a custom underlying database (hybrid of graph and relational) which resulted in the acquisition of the company `[ Java. Golang. ANTLR. Titan. Neo4J ]`
 - lead development for a graph orchestration framework used to execute AI workloads (primarily Computer Vision & Genomics). We built the company and sold it in less than a year. `[ C++. Python ]`
 - added support into the Terraform AWS provider for shipping keys to ACM `[ Golang ]`
 - developed an orchestration framework for researchers in AI to schedule workloads `[ Python. Terraform. AWS. On-prem (Nvidia DGX's). QEMU. Libvirt ]`
 - customised redhat's Clair product so that it could use internal sources for its vulnerability databases `[ Golang ]` allowing a large bank to use it in airgapped environments.
 - developed a compliance tool which detects packages for Python, Ruby, R, APT, Yum, APK and assesses their licenses `[ Shell ]`. This replaced the need for BlackDuck saving the company _a lot_ of money.
 - developed a chatbot which used a large car forum database, bayes theorum and more regular expressions than you can shake a stick at to allow users to talk to cars. in 3 weeks! `[ PHP, Postgres ]`
 - built a security tool "amald" which alerts on the event that an endpoint is without authentication. decreased companies time-to-detection for auth misconfigurations `[ Golang ]`
 - developed an image delivery service for a very large org (30k+ engineers) which hardened VM images for AWS and a private cloud `[ AWS. Python. Bash/Shell. OpenStack ]`
 - design and build out of various deployment infrastructure `[ Kubernetes. Mesos. Marathon. Docker-compose. ]`
 - developed a Jira plugin which extended JQL (jira query language) to allow grouping by "roles" `[ Java ]`
 - competed in various hackathons and code jams `[ Hacktoberfest. Ludum Dare. Google CTF ]`
 - mentored many amazing engineers over the years from Junior to Staff
 - spoken at various conferences in the UK, Ireland, Australia and the U.S on docker, prometheus, bash, terraform, aws, automation, python, golang etc
 - in my early web years I co-founded an award winning web development company (31interactive)

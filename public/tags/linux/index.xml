&lt;p&gt;I should have read this years ago. It&amp;rsquo;s a big boi, but if you work around linux
or are interested in it - this book is a critical primer on many of the core
topics you&amp;rsquo;ll need to really understand what&amp;rsquo;s going on. I binged this book on
the first pass over multiple weeks - deliberately skipping implementing the
code examples, opting to just read them / ensure I understood them. I choose to
do this so that I could get over as much content as possible, with the view of
circling back over the examples once I&amp;rsquo;m finished The C Programming Language
book so that I can make better decisions about the code I&amp;rsquo;m writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://s.cdnshm.com/catalog/pt/t/33820519/linux-programming-interface.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Buy it&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Linux-Programming-Interface-System-Handbook/dp/1593272200&#34;&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Linux-Programming-Interface-System-Handbook/dp/1593272200&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-c-programming-language&#34;&gt;The C Programming Language&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I generally try to avoid taking on multiple books but I figured as the above is
so large and much of the books example code is given in C, then this book which
I&amp;rsquo;m long overdue on would be a nice complement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fine. Concise and clear wording; unlike the print quality, unfortunately.
This books print looks like it was hand-painted by a very nervous individual trying
to hit a deadline in the dark. Print-quality aside, I&amp;rsquo;d say this is an
important book to read, but not much of a page-turner. For me the biggest
advantage of the book was seeing syscall libraries in action and also
appreciating more about what cpp gives us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C1bOAdsnZnS._CR504,0,3024,3024_UX256.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Buy it&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/C-Programming-Language-2nd/dp/0131103628&#34;&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/C-Programming-Language-2nd/dp/0131103628&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;up-next&#34;&gt;Up next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two &amp;ldquo;crackers&amp;rdquo; on my desk. Really looking forward to these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linux Kernel Development (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Linux-Kernel-Development-Developers-Library/dp/0672329468&#34;&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Linux-Kernel-Development-Developers-Library/dp/0672329468&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Systems Performance (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Systems-Performance-Brendan-Gregg/dp/0136820158&#34;&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Systems-Performance-Brendan-Gregg/dp/0136820158&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

      <content>&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT, the open-source version of the GPT-3 language model developed by OpenAI, has the potential to revolutionize the way senior software engineers approach their daily workflow. With its ability to generate human-like text, ChatGPT can help senior software engineers save time and reduce errors in a variety of tasks, from coding and debugging to documenting and collaborating with colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key advantages of using ChatGPT is its ability to generate high-quality code. Senior software engineers can use ChatGPT to quickly prototype new features, test out different approaches to solving a problem, or even generate entire codebases for new projects. This can save senior software engineers a significant amount of time and allow them to focus on more complex and challenging tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to generating code, ChatGPT can also help senior software engineers with debugging and troubleshooting. By providing natural language descriptions of bugs and errors, senior software engineers can use ChatGPT to generate possible solutions or workarounds. This can save them the time and frustration of trying to figure out a solution on their own, and allow them to quickly get back to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important way that ChatGPT can help senior software engineers is by improving the documentation of their code and projects. With its ability to generate human-like text, ChatGPT can help senior software engineers write clear and concise documentation that is easy for others to understand. This can improve collaboration within teams and ensure that everyone is on the same page when working on a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, ChatGPT has the potential to greatly improve the daily workflow of senior software engineers. By helping them generate high-quality code, troubleshoot problems, and write clear documentation, ChatGPT can save senior software engineers time and reduce errors, allowing them to focus on more important tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>chatGPT - building an automated database testing tool</title>

      <description>Creating an automated database testing tool with ChatGPT Last night I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try to get ChatGPT to make an automated database testing tool and the results were quite promising.
In conclusion, with guidance, it was able to build a project from scratch that ran a python script and postgres database. It generated some random schema and values for the randomly generated tables. It provided a Python script which would introspect the database and execute queries against it.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Last night I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try to get ChatGPT to make an automated database
testing tool and the results were quite promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, with guidance, it was able to build a project from scratch that
ran a python script and postgres database. It generated some random schema and
values for the randomly generated tables. It provided a Python script which
would introspect the database and execute queries against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did it all work out of the box? No. There are some bugs to fix in the python
script it generated. However the effort to go in and fix those is not high and
certainly the whole end-to-end process is cheaper, time-wise, compared to
starting from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that the bugs it encountered were largely due to my lack of clarity or
ordering of questions posed to it. It was quite capable of fixing its own
mistakes / updating the existing code to match the new requirements when
requested to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; issue I encountered were general API errors that one would
expect of something so popular in an early preview state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came away from this experiment viewing ChatGPT and whatever follows it as a
really useful development aide for those who already know how to program. It
helped me build a tool faster than I could have had I sat down to do it from
scratch. I don&amp;rsquo;t view it as a replacement for software engineers yet for two
main reasons - firstly: for non-trivial applications I suspect the person
feeding requirements into the system (or &amp;ldquo;prompt engineer&amp;rdquo;) needs to have a
reasonable idea of how to build software in the first place, so as to know how
to form requests and to correct mistakes / close gaps. secondly: the code being
generated isn&amp;rsquo;t always sound - without an experienced engineer reviewing and
taking ownership of whatever code is produced (ownership being important for
maintainence reasons) then there&amp;rsquo;s little guarantee that you will get what you
are hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However; this is still very early days. Can the problems outlined be closed
further? Absolutely. Will this sort of tooling be &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; for software
engineering as a whole, long-term? Perhaps. Personally I&amp;rsquo;m very excited to have
this tool in my arsenal - already it has allowed me to scaffold prototype
applications quickly. Would I use it for production code in a workplace? No
more or less than I would snippets from stackoverflow or it&amp;rsquo;s ilk. For now.&lt;/p&gt;

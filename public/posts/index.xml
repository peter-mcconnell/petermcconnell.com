      <description>Creating an automated database testing tool with ChatGPT Last night I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try to get ChatGPT to make an automated database testing tool and the results were quite promising.
In conclusion, with guidance, it was able to build a project from scratch that ran a python script and postgres database. It generated some random schema and values for the randomly generated tables. It provided a Python script which would introspect the database and execute queries against it.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Last night I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try to get ChatGPT to make an automated database
testing tool and the results were quite promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, with guidance, it was able to build a project from scratch that
ran a python script and postgres database. It generated some random schema and
values for the randomly generated tables. It provided a Python script which
would introspect the database and execute queries against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did it all work out of the box? No. There are some bugs to fix in the python
script it generated. However the effort to go in and fix those is not high and
certainly the whole end-to-end process is cheaper, time-wise, compared to
starting from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that the bugs it encountered were largely due to my lack of clarity or
ordering of questions posed to it. It was quite capable of fixing its own
mistakes / updating the existing code to match the new requirements when
requested to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; issue I encountered were general API errors that one would
expect of something so popular in an early preview state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came away from this experiment viewing ChatGPT and whatever follows it as a
really useful development aide for those who already know how to program. It
helped me build a tool faster than I could have had I sat down to do it from
scratch. I don&amp;rsquo;t view it as a replacement for software engineers yet for two
main reasons - firstly: for non-trivial applications I suspect the person
feeding requirements into the system (or &amp;ldquo;prompt engineer&amp;rdquo;) needs to have a
reasonable idea of how to build software in the first place, so as to know how
to form requests and to correct mistakes / close gaps. secondly: the code being
generated isn&amp;rsquo;t always sound - without an experienced engineer reviewing and
taking ownership of whatever code is produced (ownership being important for
maintainence reasons) then there&amp;rsquo;s little guarantee that you will get what you
are hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However; this is still very early days. Can the problems outlined be closed
further? Absolutely. Will this sort of tooling be &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; for software
engineering as a whole, long-term? Perhaps. Personally I&amp;rsquo;m very excited to have
this tool in my arsenal - already it has allowed me to scaffold prototype
applications quickly. Would I use it for production code in a workplace? No
more or less than I would snippets from stackoverflow or it&amp;rsquo;s ilk. For now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>How I set this website up, for free tldr; Hugo + Github + AWS Amplify. Easy peasy. total time: 1 hour (mostly spent writing content)
Some parameters:
free templates. I&amp;rsquo;m no designer static web asset output is fine. I&amp;rsquo;m not building a backend (yet) but having the option to do so is a bonus this project should be as low effort as possible so; no html / css / js where possible also; automated deploys on push to $branch ideally I don&amp;rsquo;t need to maintain ci to do this.</description>
      <content>&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-i-set-this-website-up-for-free&#34;&gt;How I set this website up, for free&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tldr; Hugo + Github + AWS Amplify. Easy peasy.
total time: 1 hour (mostly spent writing content)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some parameters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;free templates. I&amp;rsquo;m no designer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;static web asset output is fine. I&amp;rsquo;m not building a backend (yet)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but having the option to do so is a bonus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this project should be as low effort as possible
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;so; no html / css / js where possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;also; automated deploys on push to $branch
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ideally I don&amp;rsquo;t need to maintain ci to do this. lowest poss. effort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as cheap to host as possible. free, ideally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary I want to only write page content. No code. No pipelines. No buttons
to click. But I still want uri&amp;rsquo;s, the abililty to render rich media and a pretty
template that I need to do nothing with. And I&amp;rsquo;d like to not pay for any of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;static-web-files&#34;&gt;static web files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about Hugo for years but never had the opportunity to try it out and
knew from the criteria I had that it should solve getting me the static assets
quickly. Even if it didn&amp;rsquo;t turn out to be the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; tool, I knew
experimentation would be cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install was super easy: &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/installation/linux/&#34;&gt;https://gohugo.io/installation/linux/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then jumped over to &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/&#34;&gt;https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quick start guide felt like all I&amp;rsquo;d need so I went searching for a theme.
The power of search engines brought me to &lt;a href=&#34;https://hugothemesfree.com/&#34;&gt;https://hugothemesfree.com/&lt;/a&gt;. The tags
on the right of this page helped me find the terminal theme quickly
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://hugothemesfree.com/a-simple-retro-theme-for-hugo/&#34;&gt;https://hugothemesfree.com/a-simple-retro-theme-for-hugo/&lt;/a&gt;) which reminded me
of my old i3 + polybar configuration. MIT licensed too. Bingo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few &lt;code&gt;hugo new posts/thing.md&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hugo new otherthing.md&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo;s later and I had
my static website files. I opted to bake the theme into the repo so that I
could mutate the files. Created a new repository
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/peter-mcconnell/petermcconnell.com&#34;&gt;https://github.com/peter-mcconnell/petermcconnell.com&lt;/a&gt;) and threw my files
there for safe keeping. Now I just needed somewhere to host it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-search-for-cheap-hosting-solutions&#34;&gt;a search for cheap hosting solutions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious route was github pages but I wanted to look at other options
which offered some extra features should I need them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick look around lead me to AWS Amplify - a service I admittedly hadn&amp;rsquo;t
heard of before. A quick look over the marketing material
(&lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-serverless-web-app-lambda-apigateway-s3-dynamodb-cognito/module-1/&#34;&gt;https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-serverless-web-app-lambda-apigateway-s3-dynamodb-cognito/module-1/&lt;/a&gt;)
looked like it was interesting; Lambda, API Gateway, Dynamo DB - all things
that pluck on my cheap-skate heart strings. Pricing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/pricing/&#34;&gt;https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/pricing/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m no Madonna - I think my personal website is probably a safe bet to do
&amp;ldquo;free tier&amp;rdquo; numbers (&amp;lt;500k req.|15Gb egress|100Gb req. duration per month).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I logged into my personal AWS account, went through the little Amplify setup
wizard, pointed it to my github repo, updated my DNS records to whatever the
wizard was telling me to and voila - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.petermcconnell.com/&#34;&gt;https://www.petermcconnell.com/&lt;/a&gt; is up and
running.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-linux-programming-interface&#34;&gt;The Linux Programming Interface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should have read this years ago. It&amp;rsquo;s a big boi, but if you work around linux
or are interested in it - this book is a critical primer on many of the core
topics you&amp;rsquo;ll need to really understand what&amp;rsquo;s going on. I binged this book on
the first pass over multiple weeks - deliberately skipping implementing the
code examples, opting to just read them / ensure I understood them. I choose to
do this so that I could get over as much content as possible, with the view of
circling back over the examples once I&amp;rsquo;m finished The C Programming Language
book so that I can make better decisions about the code I&amp;rsquo;m writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://s.cdnshm.com/catalog/pt/t/33820519/linux-programming-interface.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Buy it&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Linux-Programming-Interface-System-Handbook/dp/1593272200&#34;&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Linux-Programming-Interface-System-Handbook/dp/1593272200&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-c-programming-language&#34;&gt;The C Programming Language&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I generally try to avoid taking on multiple books but I figured as the above is
so large and much of the books example code is given in C, then this book which
I&amp;rsquo;m long overdue on would be a nice complement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fine. Concise and clear wording; unlike the print quality, unfortunately.
This books print looks like it was hand-painted by a very nervous individual trying
to hit a deadline in the dark. Print-quality aside, I&amp;rsquo;d say this is an
important book to read, but not much of a page-turner. For me the biggest
advantage of the book was seeing syscall libraries in action and also
appreciating more about what cpp gives us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/C1bOAdsnZnS._CR504,0,3024,3024_UX256.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34; title=&#34;Buy it&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/C-Programming-Language-2nd/dp/0131103628&#34;&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/C-Programming-Language-2nd/dp/0131103628&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;up-next&#34;&gt;Up next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have two &amp;ldquo;crackers&amp;rdquo; on my desk. Really looking forward to these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linux Kernel Development (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Linux-Kernel-Development-Developers-Library/dp/0672329468&#34;&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Linux-Kernel-Development-Developers-Library/dp/0672329468&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
